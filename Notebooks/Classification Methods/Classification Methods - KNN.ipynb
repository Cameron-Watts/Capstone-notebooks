    "### Understanding the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "When you collect your own data, you should know exactly what each of the variables represent, and how the variables are encoded. Unfortunately, when working with others' data, we don't start with a full understanding of the data. Not being able to understand the data makes it extremely difficult to gain insight from it. You should definitely document any data of your own, as you might have to come back to it later, or someone else might have to interpret it in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out with the original dataset that was planned to be used in this example ([Kaggle Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)), it is also important to check the integrity of the dataset, especially if we plan to use the insights that we extract from the data. Resulting from investigation of the data, it seems that this source has edited data, and is misleading in various areas (for example, the indicator variable values for heart disease were swapped!). Therefore, we swap to using a correct version of the dataset, cited by multiple papers using this: [UCI Machine Learning Repository Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease). This illustrates just how important it is to be able to trust our datasets if we're planning to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the UCI Machine Learning Repository, there is an accurate description of every column, of which only 14 are used (we will keep with this convention and only use these columns). The description of these columns is given as follows, to help our understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- age: age in years\n",
    "- sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)\n",
    "- cp: chest pain type\n",
    "1. Value 1: typical angina\n",
    "2. Value 2: atypical angina\n",
    "3. Value 3: non-anginal pain\n",
    "4. Value 4: asymptomatic\n",
    "- trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n",
    "- chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n",
    "- fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)\n",
    "- restecg: resting electrocardiographic results\n",
    "0. Value 0: normal\n",
    "1. Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)\n",
    "2. Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria\n",
    "- thalach: maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "- exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n",
    "- oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n",
    "- slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
    "1. Value 1: upsloping\n",
    "2. Value 2: flat\n",
    "3. Value 3: downsloping\n",
    "- ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n",
    "- thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect\n",
    "- num: diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)\n",
    "0. Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing (No disease)\n",
    "1. Value 1-4: > 50% diameter narrowing (Disease)\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"num\" variable is used as our target value, and as described in the description of the dataset, non-zero values here indicate disease. Therefore, we can later transform our dataset to have either a 0, or a 1 for any disease."

We don't yet add these variables back into the DataFrame because of the scaling step that we will perform later, that is not appropriate for categorical variables such as these. Later, we will reconstruct a full DataFrame, such that we can train our KNN model."
