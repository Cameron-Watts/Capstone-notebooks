    "### Understanding the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "When you collect your own data, you should know exactly what each of the variables represent, and how the variables are encoded. Unfortunately, when working with others' data, we don't start with a full understanding of the data. Not being able to understand the data makes it extremely difficult to gain insight from it. You should definitely document any data of your own, as you might have to come back to it later, or someone else might have to interpret it in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out with the original dataset that was planned to be used in this example ([Kaggle Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)), it is also important to check the integrity of the dataset, especially if we plan to use the insights that we extract from the data. Resulting from investigation of the data, it seems that this source has edited data, and is misleading in various areas (for example, the indicator variable values for heart disease were swapped!). Therefore, we swap to using a correct version of the dataset, cited by multiple papers using this: [UCI Machine Learning Repository Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease). This illustrates just how important it is to be able to trust our datasets if we're planning to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the UCI Machine Learning Repository, there is an accurate description of every column, of which only 14 are used (we will keep with this convention and only use these columns). The description of these columns is given as follows, to help our understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- age: age in years\n",
    "- sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)\n",
    "- cp: chest pain type\n",
    "1. Value 1: typical angina\n",
    "2. Value 2: atypical angina\n",
    "3. Value 3: non-anginal pain\n",
    "4. Value 4: asymptomatic\n",
    "- trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n",
    "- chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n",
    "- fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)\n",
    "- restecg: resting electrocardiographic results\n",
    "0. Value 0: normal\n",
    "1. Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)\n",
    "2. Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria\n",
    "- thalach: maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "- exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n",
    "- oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n",
    "- slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
    "1. Value 1: upsloping\n",
    "2. Value 2: flat\n",
    "3. Value 3: downsloping\n",
    "- ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n",
    "- thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect\n",
    "- num: diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)\n",
    "0. Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing (No disease)\n",
    "1. Value 1-4: > 50% diameter narrowing (Disease)\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"num\" variable is used as our target value, and as described in the description of the dataset, non-zero values here indicate disease. Therefore, we can later transform our dataset to have either a 0, or a 1 for any disease."

This involves splitting our data into several \"folds\" (a given fraction of the data). We then choose a value of K to test, and train our data on all but one of these folds. The remaining fold is tested upon, to get a test-data accuracy score. We repeat this with each one of the folds being left out, and get an average test-data score, without using the real test data! This process is completed for each value of K that we want to test, and we take the value that scored the best on our defined metric (this time we'll use accuracy).\n",

    "We can do this automatically with Scikit-Learn's GridSearchCV. Here, we search through ranges from K=1 to K=10 (remember that ranges in Python are non-inclusive at the top-end), to see which gives us the best performance. Before running this, we likely expect a value of K=2 or K=3 to appear best, as this doesn't take only the nearest point into consideration, which might be too sensitive. We also don't expect K=10 to be the best, as this takes a lot of points into account, and might miss some \"areas\" of classification that don't have a lot of samples in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than one parameter can be changed through a grid search, but be warned that we're creating many more possibilities to check when doing so. For example, currently we test 10 different values of K, but if we wanted to test another parameter across 10 possible values too, we would suddenly have 100 possible combinations to check. You can see how this might quickly scale for more complicated implementations, where we test 1000s of possible combinations on huge datasets. This is why the absolute best machine learning implementations require such huge computational power!"
