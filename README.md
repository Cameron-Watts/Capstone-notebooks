# Capstone-notebooks
Contains all notebooks and data used in the process of my Capstone project (So I Data, What Now? Machine Learning for Biologists), as a repository for those wanting to learn from these resources. These notebooks are companion coding tutorials to a series of articles published on Medium at https://cameronwwatts.medium.com/
